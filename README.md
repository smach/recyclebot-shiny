# Recyclebot Shiny Python Version

This is the code behind my [Framingham Recyclebot app](https://smach.shinyapps.io/recyclebot/).

It's a Shiny Python version of my Framingham Recyclebot that I originally created with a Chainlit front end. I like Chainlit - it's a nice balance of easy with the basics I wanted - but there aren't a lot of places where you can easily deplot it too that also have inexpensive, predictable monthly pricing instead of pricing by usage. This is a hobby public service app, I don't feel like spending $100 or $200 a year to host it!

I also wanted to learn Shiny Python. (I know Shiny for R, but I'm using the LangChain Python framework for the generative AI part of this). I ended up asking Posit's [Shiny Assistant](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/) to 'translate' my existing app into Shiny. It took awhile to get it working, but here it is!

[Shiny Assistant](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/) is awesome, by the way. Thanks very much to Posit for hosting this resource.
